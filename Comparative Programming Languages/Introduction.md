### Declarative Language
HTML and CSS are decalrative languages, they care about the end result and not the steps taken


### Imperative Language
It's like giving directions. 
We need to provide the computer the exact steps. 


### Refactoring 
Practice of reorganising code. Reducing the complexity and adding more features


Assembly language (8085): Most basic language. 

Higher language is more readable and code is more easy to understand. 


### Debugging
Debugging is the process of indentifying and fixing problems in the software and hardware. 

One way is to print the outputs while coding, returning the expected values. The other way is to use 
a debugger.
